# College Search React app

Just a very simple app that I created to learn Apollo-client and interact with GraphQL from the client side. The front-end is hosted on S3 with the backend hosted in Heroku using my own [GraphQL CollegeData API](https://github.com/blakenoll/CollegeData-API).

Currently available to search by city and name with the ability to search by state coming soon.

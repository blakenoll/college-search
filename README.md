App to search for collges using my own graphql CollegeData API.

Just a very simple app that I created to learn Apollo-client and interact with GraphQL from the client side. 

Link to App hosted on S3 wit GraphQL backend hosted on Heroku: [http://college-search-front-end.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/](http://college-search-front-end.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/)

Currently available to search by city and name with the ability to search by state coming soon.
